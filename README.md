# Beaver Triplet

## What Is the Beaver Triplet?

In 1992, Donald Beaver, a researcher of AT&T laboratories, proposed a secure computation (especially multiplication) by secret sharing in the thesis ["Efficient Multiparty Protocols Using Circuit Randomization"](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-46766-1_34.pdf).
His method has been called "Beaver Triplet".

## Why I Made This Repository?

I am (as you read this, I was) a university student in Department of Mathematical and Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kumamoto University.
When I was senior (2020/04 - 2021/03), I had studied "secure computation by secret sharing" for my graduation thesis, and I was interested in Beaver Triplet.

## What Does This Repository Good for You?

In this repository, I implemented Beaver Triplet in Python and I generalized for multiplicating matrix and matrix.
I wish these codes will make you happy ;)
